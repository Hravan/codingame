#Binary with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0, or almost, is even better! Originally, this is a concept designed by Chuck Norris to send so called unary messages.
#
#Write a program that takes an incoming message as input and displays as output the message encoded using Chuck Norrisâ€™ method.

#Here is the encoding principle:
#
#    The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)
#    The encoded output message consists of blocks of 0
#    A block is separated from another block by a space
#    Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only 1 or 0 values):
#    - First block: it is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1, if not, it contains 0
#    - Second block: the number of 0 in this block is the number of bits in the series
